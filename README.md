## Synopsis

Experimentation with [Strava API v3](https://strava.github.io/api/).

Is a Flask app.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Strava users, including yourself, are competitive people. 

Finally, you have a way to claim irrefutable supriority over another user. Or in the case the statistics are not in the your favour, you'll be more motivated to get stronger. 

## Installation

Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Git clone, create and activate venv, install requirements, then `python flask_exp.py`.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
